### What is Budgup
 
 Budgup is an application that helps you manage your money. Indeed, with our algorithm you can predict you balance at the end of the month.

## :heavy_check_mark: Release 0.2.0
 
 With that first version of budgup you can :
 
  - [x] See all you future spent in a very explicit way.
  - [x] Anticipate you balance : if an operation occurred more than twice during the last three months, that means that you'll probably have the same the next month.
  
## :heavy_check_mark: Release Alpha : 1.0
 
 Thanks to the features coming, the algorithm will be more precise. It will be able to :
 
 - [x] Detect all the operations already paid
 - [x] Give you a spending range (min / max) for the irregular operations 
 - [x] To handle the case where the same raw occurs more than once during the same month
 

 
## :heavy_check_mark: Release Alpha 2 : 1.1

 - [x] You can test the three versions of our super algorithm.
 - [x] Now you can dowload your own json file and apply the three version of the algorithm. Thus you can see the improvement of our releases.
